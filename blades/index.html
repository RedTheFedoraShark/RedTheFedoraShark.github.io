                    <h4>About</h4>
                    Blades in the Dark is an RPG system by John Harper. It comes with it's own calendar system. This interactive calendar was made for the purpose of recording events during my campaign in the game. 
                    <h4>The Calendar</h4> 
                    Year in BitD is split into 6 months, each split into 10 weeks. A week has 6 days, giving a 360 day year with 60 day months. Around Doskvol there are three seasons: cold winter (Mendar and Elisar), rainy spring (Kalivet and Suran) and stormy autumn (Ulsivet and Volvinet). <a class="a" href="https://bladesofdoskvol.fandom.com/wiki/Calendar_and_Time">Read more.</a>
